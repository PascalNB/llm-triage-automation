\section{Related Work}

Go to Google scholar and search using keywords related to your research. Then,
download some paper that the title immediately show similarities with your
research. You must be able to judge the strong and weak-points of each paper.
Also, you can extend your literature study by looking the related work section
of each downloaded paper. In addition to that, you can look who cited the papers
that you decided to include (till this moment) on your research (google scholar
shows this information for you). This step is important because the papers that
cited the paper that you decide to include on your research are potential papers
to include on your section. Note that the final goal of this section is a table
that summarizes the characteristics of each paper and your critical analysis to
highlight the existing gaps of research.
