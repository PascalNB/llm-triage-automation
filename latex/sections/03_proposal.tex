\section{Proposal}

In this part I would like you to add a conceptual figure with your idea (if possible). On this, I must say that Figures MUST be in pdf format (I like to use Inkscape to create my figures, then I export to pdf) [ask me how, for help]. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\label{fig:approach}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/example.eps}
	\caption{Example of Figure.}
\end{figure}
