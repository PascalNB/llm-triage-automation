# Minor overall common mistakes:
- **Acronyms.** You should first write the full term then, between parenthesis, write the acronym. For example: Azure Active Directory (AAD). After introducing an acronym you can use it without writing the full term for at least a session. If you feel the need to define again the acronym in another session or chapter please do so. You donâ€™t want the reader to stop his/her reading flow to check acronyms in another page.
