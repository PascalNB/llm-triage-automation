\begin{abstract}
    In Security Operation Centers, security analysts have the task to inspect cybersecurity alarms to filter false
    positives and identify their severity: triage.
    The problem with this process is that it is complicated and time-consuming, limiting the depth and speed of
    investigations.
    Whereas other proposed optimizations and automations appear to be very promising, rapid advancements in the
    development of Large Language Models (LLMs) opened up new possibilities to speed up the triage process.
    % TODO: examples
    This research will identify ways in which LLMs can optimize triage, evaluate the performance of these techniques and
    offer a comparison between different LLMs.
    The findings in this study are expected to help security teams in making informed implementation decisions when
    optimizing the triage process.
