    In Security Information and Event Management, alerts are created when certain conditions are met.
    Security analysts have the task to inspect alerts to filter false positives and identify their severity: triage.
    This process is complicated and time-consuming, limiting the depth and speed of investigations.
    Whereas other proposed optimizations and automations appear to be very promising, rapid advancements in Natural Language Processing and the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) opened up new possibilities to speed up the triage process.
    This research will identify ways in which LLMs can optimize triage, evaluate the performance of these techniques and offer a comparison between different LLMs.
    The research is expected to help security teams in making informed implementation decisions when optimizing the triage process.
