\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

To pursue our goal, we have defined the following research questions (RQ) as the basis of our research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1:} How can LLMs be integrated into the existing incident response workflow to streamline the triage process?
    \item \textbf{RQ2:} What evaluation metrics are suitable to assess the performance of LLMs in cybersecurity triage?
    \item \textbf{RQ3:} How do different LLMs compare in performance when categorizing cybersecurity incidents as high, medium, low or no risk?
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this proposal is organized as follows.
Section 2 will discuss the approaches expected for answering each research question.
After that, we present a preliminary planning for the research questions in Section 3.
Finally, we conclude with a proposal and planning for the thesis structure in Section 4.
