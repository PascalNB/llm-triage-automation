\section{Planning}
\label{sec:planning}

In this section we will shortly discuss the planning of the study.
The study has been split into six parts, as can be seen in the table below.
Note that a planning such as this when is to be seen as a guideline.
There are however some hard deadlines for handing in drafts and final versions.
Here we have an overview of the deadlines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item May 13th: Research proposal acceptance
    \item June 13th: Draft paper submission
    \item June 30th: Final paper submission
    \item July 5th: Conference presentation
\end{itemize}

The planning is made in order to adhere to these submission deadlines.

% The research topics part consists solely of a literature study that focuses on ... All relevant information learned from this will be integrated in a survey that will form the first part of the thesis.

% Following the research topics are each of the research questions, with time allotted at the end of each research question to integrate the results into the thesis.
