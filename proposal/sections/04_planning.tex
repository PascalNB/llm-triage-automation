\section{Planning}
\label{sec:planning}

In this section we will shortly discuss the planning of the study.
The study has been split into six parts, as can be seen in the table below.
Note that a planning such as this when is to be seen as a guideline.
There are however some hard deadlines for handing in drafts and final versions.
Here we have an overview of the deadlines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item December 1st: Final proposal submission
    \item January 19th: Draft paper submission
    \item January 26th: Final paper submission
    \item January 31sh: Conference presentation
\end{itemize}
The planning is made in order to adhere to these submission deadlines.
