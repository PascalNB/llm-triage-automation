\section{Planning}
 In this section we will shortly discuss the planning of the study. The study has been split into six parts, as can be seen in the table below. Note that a planning such as this when is to be seen as a guideline. There are however some hard deadlines for handing in drafts and final versions. Here we have an overview of the deadlines:
 \begin{itemize}	
	\item December 1st: Final proposal submission
	\item January 19th: Draft paper submission
	\item January 26th: Final paper submission
	\item January 31th: Conference presentation
\end{itemize}
The planning is made in order to adhere to these submission deadlines.
